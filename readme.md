# Spencer's JavaScript30 Challenge

This is where I'm publishing my #javascript30 challenge solutions. My approach is to build each project on my own before watching the video and then learning better ways to do the things from the video. In some cases I'll extend the projects and I'll try to note that here.

You can browse my solutions to the projects that I've completed in this repo. This repo is a fork of the original [javascript30 repo](https://github.com/wesbos/JavaScript30).

If you're interested in joining, the challenge is free and available here: [javascript30.com](https://javascript30.com)

#### 1. [Javascript Drum Kit](01-javascript-drum-kit)
This was a fun little project. I hadn't done much of anything with the `<audio>` element yet and it was pretty cool seeing how easy it was to implement a basic drum machine like this. I added mouse functionality to the project before I realized that the original was keyboard input only. My solution is similar but differently implemented than the original. 

Completion Time: ~45 Minutes
