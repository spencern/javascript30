# Spencer's JavaScript30 Challenge

This is where I'm publishing my #javascript30 challenge solutions. My approach is to build each project on my own before watching the video and then learning better ways to do the things from the video. In some cases I'll extend the projects and I'll try to note that here.

You can browse my solutions to the projects that I've completed in this repo. This repo is a fork of the original [javascript30 repo](https://github.com/wesbos/JavaScript30).

If you're interested in joining, the challenge is free and available here: [javascript30.com](https://javascript30.com)

#### 1. [Javascript Drum Kit](01-javascript-drum-kit)
This was a fun little project. I hadn't done much of anything with the `<audio>` element yet and it was pretty cool seeing how easy it was to implement a basic drum machine like this. I added mouse functionality to the project before I realized that the original was keyboard input only. My solution is similar but differently implemented than the original. 

Completion Time: ~45 Minutes

#### 2. [Javascript Clock](02-js-and-css-clock)
Quick project. Hadn't ever built an analog clock in JS before, now I have.

🕒 ✔ 

Hadn't used `transform-origin` before, so that was nice to learn about. Will come in handy at some point I'm sure. CSS Transforms are super easy and seem pretty powerful. It's nice to be using them during this challenge as they will feel second nature by the end of the week I'm sure.

Completion Time: ~30 Minutes

#### 3. [CSS Variables](03-css-variables)

Nice intro to CSS variables. These will be super powerful once they are more widely adopted. Unfortunately they don't work in IE or Edge currently so we've got a bit more time until we can start using them in production. According to [http://caniuse.com/#feat=css-variables](http://caniuse.com/#feat=css-variables) they've had support in Chrome since 49 and Firefox since 31. Safari, Opera, iOS Safari, and Chrome for Android also are supported currently. MS Edge is working on it and I doubt we'll ever see it in IE 11.
